  Hello, everyone
</h1>
<p>
  This is my another repository about aos (Animation On Scroll). <br>
  Some people thinks that animation on scroll is only possible by jquery plugin or only plugin. But I think different. I am on a mission on doing everythihg without any plugin but only vanilla javascript. So, in this attempt, I have made a new file on aos. By following these instruction, you can be able to make cool animations trigged by scroll event. <br>
